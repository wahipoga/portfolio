# **Super Square Runner**
An addictive infinite runner inspired by the Chrome dinosaur, with a modern twist! Control a square dinosaur, dodge obstacles, collect special power-ups, and survive as long as you can in a world that gets faster and more challenging.

This is my very first game using **Python and Raylib**!
